# Slow Pipeline Demo

This is a standalone scrapy project that demonstrates what happens if persisting items in the item pipeline takes longer than the rate of extraction.

## To run

Execute : ./run_demo.py

## To monitor bubbling items

You can use the trackref module either through the telnet console or via another means.
